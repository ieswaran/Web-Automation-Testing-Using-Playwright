/*Assignment Requirements:
Create the following variables using let (not using var) and check their typeOf
a) firstName
b) companyName
c) mobileNumber
d) isAutomation
e) hasPlaywright (do not assign)
Print and confirm the values and data types
Hints to Solve:
Focus on initializing variables with different values, including a string, number, boolean, and leave one
variable undefined to practice with typeof.*/

// Variable Declarations and Initializations
let firstName = "Eswaran";            // String
let companyName = "Anko GCC";          // String
let mobileNumber = 9876543210;       // Number
let isAutomation = true;             // Boolean
let hasPlaywright;                   // Undefined (no value assigned)

console.log("firstName:", firstName, "| type:", typeof firstName);
console.log("companyName:", companyName, "| type:", typeof companyName);
console.log("mobileNumber:", mobileNumber, "| type:", typeof mobileNumber);
console.log("isAutomation:", isAutomation, "| type:", typeof isAutomation);
